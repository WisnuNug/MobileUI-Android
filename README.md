MOBILEUI Android

I wonder why only mobile has a different UI display from other versions. maybe because of the small screen?? !

Some people want the appearance of the game to be the same as
the Switch or PC version, because the display is very beautiful and can change according to realtime.
With these mods you can feel it!!

Mobile UI mods replace vanilla time box with original game version!!

These mods are made specifically for Android players, and not for PC.

These Mods are highly compatible with several User Interface (CP) Mods Like vintage, overgrown etc.

I'm not good at writing C# code but I'm still learning to understand it. If there's anything written about how it works or something else that I might be wrong, please help me, thank you.
